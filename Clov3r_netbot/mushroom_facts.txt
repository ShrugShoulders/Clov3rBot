Some mushrooms, like the chanterelle, are highly prized by foragers and chefs for their distinctive flavor.
The matsutake mushroom is known for its spicy-aromatic odor, often described as a mix of cinnamon, red hots, and pine.
Mycophiles are individuals with a deep passion for mushrooms, often engaging in mushroom foraging and identification.
Some mushrooms, like the stinkhorn, attract flies with their foul odor to aid in spore dispersal.
The "strobilomyces strobilaceus," commonly known as the old man of the woods, is named for its shaggy appearance resembling a beard.
Some mushrooms, like the candy cap, have a sweet aroma and are used to flavor desserts and confections.
Mycotoxins produced by certain fungi can contaminate crops and pose health risks to humans and animals.
The "blewit" mushroom (Clitocybe nuda) gets its name from its lilac to purple color and is valued for its taste and texture.
Some mushrooms, like the earthstar (Geastrum spp.), have a star-like structure when mature, aiding in spore dispersal.
The false chanterelle (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) resembles the true chanterelle but is not recommended for consumption.
Fungi in the genus Mycena are known for their small size and often bioluminescent properties.
The term "lichenized fungi" refers to fungi that form mutualistic relationships with algae or cyanobacteria, creating lichens.
Some mushrooms, like the king trumpet mushroom, are often used as meat substitutes in vegetarian and vegan dishes due to their meaty texture.
The spores of mushrooms can be used to create spore prints, which are unique patterns that help identify mushroom species.
Some mushrooms, like the oyster mushroom, are capable of breaking down complex hydrocarbons, contributing to environmental cleanup.
The fairy ring phenomenon occurs when mushrooms grow in a circular pattern, often caused by the outward growth of mycelium from a central point.
Turkey tail mushroom (Trametes versicolor) is being researched for its potential anticancer properties and immune system support.
The concept of "mycogeochemistry" involves studying the role of fungi in the cycling of elements in ecosystems.
Some mushrooms, like the fly agaric, contain compounds that were historically used by various cultures for their hallucinogenic effects.
The term "mycotectonics" refers to the study of the structural impact of fungi on landscapes over geological time.
Some mushrooms, like the reishi, have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for their potential to promote longevity and enhance vitality.
The smell of truffles is often described as earthy and pungent, and certain truffle species can be located with the help of trained truffle-hunting animals.
The Amanita muscaria mushroom has been used in Siberian shamanic rituals for its psychoactive properties.
Some mushrooms, like the lion's mane, are believed to have potential cognitive benefits and may support brain health.
The term "mycoparasitism" refers to the ability of fungi to parasitize other fungi for nutrients.
Some mushrooms, like the maitake, are known for their adaptogenic properties, helping the body adapt to stress.
The concept of "mycorrhizal networks" involves underground connections between multiple plants facilitated by fungal mycelium.
Some mushrooms, like the enoki, are cultivated in low-light conditions to encourage long, thin stems.
The Amanita phalloides, or death cap mushroom, contains potent toxins that can lead to organ failure and death if ingested.
The mycorrhizal relationship between fungi and plants involves the exchange of nutrients, with the fungus aiding in mineral absorption for the plant.
The effects of psilocybin mushrooms typically last between 4 to 6 hours, with the peak occurring within the first 2 hours after ingestion.
While psilocybin mushrooms are generally considered to have a low potential for toxicity, improper identification of wild mushrooms can lead to accidental ingestion of toxic species.
Individuals with a personal or family history of mental health issues may be more vulnerable to adverse psychological effects.
The legal status of psilocybin mushrooms varies around the world. Some countries and regions have decriminalized their use, while others strictly prohibit it.
Recent studies have explored the potential therapeutic benefits of psilocybin, including its use in treating depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Short-term effects of psilocybin mushrooms include altered sensory perception, euphoria, introspection, and enhanced creativity. Users may also experience nausea, anxiety, or paranoia.
The potency of psilocybin mushrooms can vary widely between species and even within the same species. Dosage is usually measured in grams of dried mushrooms, with effects depending on factors such as body weight and individual sensitivity.
Psilocybin mushrooms can alter perception, cognition, and mood. Users may experience vivid visual hallucinations, changes in time perception, and a heightened sense of introspection.
Indigenous cultures have used psychedelic mushrooms for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies. Some tribes in Central and South America have a long history of using mushrooms in shamanistic practices.
Psilocybin mushrooms can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They often thrive in damp, wooded areas and are commonly associated with decomposing organic matter.
Psilocybin mushrooms belong to several different species, with some of the most well-known being Psilocybe cubensis, Psilocybe semilanceata, and Psilocybe cyanescens.
Psilocybin is the primary psychoactive compound in these mushrooms. Upon ingestion, the body converts psilocybin into psilocin, which is responsible for the hallucinogenic effects.
The deathcap is one of the most toxic mushrooms known to humans. It contains potent toxins, including amatoxins, which can cause severe liver and kidney damage.
The deathcap has a cap that is usually olive-green to yellowish-brown in color, but it can also be white. The cap is often smooth and shiny, and it can grow up to 6-15 cm (2.4-6 inches) in diameter.
The gills of the deathcap are white and crowded, and the spore print is white. These features help in distinguishing it from other, non-toxic mushrooms.
The deathcap typically has a white ring on the upper stalk, and it often has a cup-like structure at the base known as a volva. The presence of these features aids in identification.
Deathcap mushrooms are commonly found in association with various trees, especially oaks, but they can also grow near other hardwoods.
Amanita phalloides(Deathcap) is found in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, North America, and Australia. It is not limited to a specific geographical region.
Ingesting even a small amount of the deathcap can be fatal. The toxins it contains can cause severe damage to the liver and kidneys, and symptoms may not appear until 6-12 hours after ingestion
Initial symptoms of deathcap poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. As the toxins progress, there may be a brief period of apparent recovery, followed by the onset of severe liver and kidney damage, which can be fatal.
There is no specific antidote for deathcap poisoning. Treatment often involves supportive measures such as fluids, medications to control symptoms, and, in severe cases, liver transplantation.
One of the dangers associated with the deathcap is that it can resemble several edible mushroom species. This makes it particularly challenging for foragers to accurately identify it without expert knowledge.
Accidental poisoning can occur when inexperienced foragers mistakenly harvest and consume the deathcap, thinking it is an edible mushroom.
"Lemon tek" is a method used by some individuals to enhance the effects of psilocybin-containing mushrooms.
The idea behind lemon tek is that the acidic environment of the citrus juice can convert the psilocybin in the mushrooms into its active form, psilocin, more rapidly than in the stomach.
Users often report a quicker onset of effects after employing the lemon tek method. The peak effects may also be more intense, but the overall duration of the trip might be slightly shorter compared to ingesting whole mushrooms.
The lemon tek method does not change the overall potency of the mushrooms, so users should still be mindful of the dosage they consume. It's important to start with a lower dose if experimenting with this method to avoid unexpected intensity.
Some individuals claim that lemon tek reduces the likelihood of experiencing nausea, a common side effect during the onset of a psilocybin trip.
The acidic nature the citrus juice with lemon tek may help break down the mushrooms more efficiently.
Lemon tek is also favored by some users because it can mask the taste of the mushrooms, which is often described as unpleasant. The acidity of the juice may help neutralize or cover up the earthy flavor.
Responses to the lemon tek method can vary among individuals. Factors such as metabolism, body weight, and sensitivity to psychedelics can influence how quickly and intensely the effects are felt.
While there is anecdotal evidence supporting the efficacy of the lemon tek method, scientific research specifically examining its effects on psilocybin absorption and metabolism is limited.
Baeyocystine is a naturally occurring amino acid that is found in certain types of mushrooms, particularly in the genus Psilocybe.
Baeyocystine is chemically related to other psychoactive compounds like psilocybin and psilocin, which are responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of magic mushrooms.
Baeyocystine's specific effects on human consciousness and perception are not yet fully understood, as research on this compound is still relatively limited compared to other psychoactive substances found in mushrooms.
Psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, can sometimes lead to challenging experiences known as "bad trips."
Bad trips can be characterized by intense anxiety, confusion, paranoia, and a distorted sense of reality.
Factors like set (mindset) and setting (environment) play a significant role in determining the outcome of a psilocybin experience.
Bad trips are often temporary and typically subside as the effects of psilocybin wear off.
Having a trusted trip sitter or experienced guide present during your psychedelic journey can help navigate difficult moments and prevent bad trips.
bad trips suck, make sure you're in a comfortable environment
Legendary mushroom trips have been known to induce profound hallucinations and altered states of consciousness, often described as a "mind-expanding" experience.
Many individuals report experiencing a sense of unity with nature or a higher power during their legendary mushroom trips, which can result in feelings of awe and spiritual connectedness.
While some people may have transformative or enlightening experiences on legendary mushroom trips, it's crucial to prioritize safety by being aware of potential risks such as impaired judgment or psychological distress that could arise during the trip.
Sarcodon imbricatus, commonly known as the shingled hedgehog or scaly hedgehog, is a species of tooth fungus in the order Thelephorales. The mushroom is edible.
"Paul Stamets is the author of six books (including Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save The World, Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms, and Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World), he has discovered and named numerous new species of psilocybin mushrooms."
"Gary Lincoff (1942–2018) was an American mycologist and naturalist. Lincoff taught at the New York Botanical Garden for over 40 years and authored numerous books and field guides on mushrooms."
"The Telluride Mushroom Festival (TMF) is a festival event happening every August in Telluride, Colorado. It’s a weekend of mycology-related forays, unique talks, special events and dinners, and of course the parade. TMF is famous for the lively experience it provides all festival participants. Every year the festival attracts 800 to 1,000 fungi fans from across the United States, and the world."
'The Mushroom and Arts Festival' (MycoFest) in Pennsylvania, USA has been held since 2015 in hopes to provide further education around all things mycology. While a family-friendly connection to nature, education, entrepreneurs in the field of mushrooms and mycology, local families/artists included, this festival is the first of its kind on the East Coast. There are workshops, forays, live music, yoga.
Puget Sound Mycological Society's "Wild Mushroom Show" often held near Seattle, WA is one of the largest and most complete exhibits of mushrooms in the United States. With over 200 varieties of wild mushrooms displayed, identified, and classified as edible, poisonous, or valueless as food, patrons of the WMS are welcome to bring finds and samples to be identified.
The North American Mycological Association leads a community of amateur mycologists and mushroom clubs. Our programs encompass education, taxonomy, recording biodiversity, cultivation, culinary and visual arts and crafts, mycotourism and more!
Computational phylogenetics comparing eukaryotes revealed that fungi are more closely related to us than to plants. Fungi and animals form a clade called opisthokonta, which is named after a single, posterior flagellum present in their last common ancestor.
Our feet contain more than 200 types of fungi. Although they live all over our bodies, their favorite spots to colonize and grow are the heel (80 types found), between the toes (40), and beneath toenails (60). Most of these fungi are totally harmless.
Armillaria ostoyae grows and spreads primarily subterranean. One location, in northeastern Oregon's Malheur National Forest is possibly the largest living organism (colloquially called the "Humongous fungus") on Earth by mass, area, and volume, covering over 3.7 square miles, with a mass of approx. 31,500 tones).
Fungi allow trees to 'talk' to each other. The fungi's underground 'roots' are made from hyphae which together make up a mycelial network. These networks have been shown in studies to facilitate exchange/transportation of nutrients and chemical messages between different species of plants. See the book 'Wood Wide Web', and related articles for more information about this concept.
Without fungi the world would be covered in organic matter, as many fungi are 'saprophytes', which break down dead materials, and keep us afloat in a terrestrial array of flora. At one time about 300 million years ago according to fossil records, mycelia adapted to break down organic matter. Prior to this the materials piled up, and compressed over time becoming fossil fuels which we now harvest for use in modern living.
Many mushrooms are famously delicious (Porcini, Chanterelles, Maitake, etc). Never eat a wild mushroom unless you are 100% positively sure its edible and safe. Always cook mushrooms, for humans do not have the digestive enzymes to break down the cellular walls of mushrooms to get nutrition from the insides of the cells. Remember, "When in doubt, throw it out!"
Fungi is what makes blue cheese, blue. Fungi (yeast) is what makes primarily ethanol (and other byproducts) during fermentation in wines, and other adult beverages. Fungi makes more Fun Guys!
In 1988 on the russian Mir Space station, it was observed that a network of hyphae started, eventually causing rubber seals to fail. It turns out that some species of fungi thrive in zero gravity and exposed to high levels of radiation. Its believed the ~600000 skin cells shed each day by each astronaut were enough 'food' for the fungi to flourish.
Each year about 2000 previously unknown species of fungi are identified. Its thought there are about six (6) times more fungi species in the world than plant species. Its estimated approximately 300 miles of mycelium exist under every foot step you take.
Some fungi are used to create or isolate life saving antibiotics, and other drugs for use in medicine. Penicillin was isolated from a fungus. During WWII, the US government took over all US production of penicillin-producing Penicillium ssp., helping to save solder's and subsequently civilian lives as well.
Two categories of mushrooms are saprophytic (decomposes dead organic matter) vs. mycorrhyzal (symbiotically growing w/living plant roots). Mycorrhyzal fungi thrive when the tree thrives, so conditions for tree is critical. Saprophytic fungi may thrive in an abundance of dead organic matter. Moisture, substrates, species of tree and fungi, light, time of year, temperatures all play a roll in fruiting success.
Slime mold or slime mould is an informal name given to a polyphyletic assemblage of unrelated eukaryotic organisms in the Stramenopiles, Rhizaria, Discoba, Amoebozoa and Holomycota. Most are microscopic; those in the Myxogastria form larger plasmodial slime molds visible to the naked eye. The slime mold life cycle includes a free-living single-celled stage and the formation of spores.
Slime mold is a polyphyletic assemblage of unrelated eukaryotic organism clades of Stramenopiles, Rhizaria, Discoba, Amoebozoa and Holomycota. Most are microscopic while Myxogastria is visible to the naked eye. A life cycle includes single-celled stage w/the formation of spores. The top speed is ~1 mm/hr. The plasmodium is not harmful, little damage, and ingests bacteria/fungal spores/smaller protozoa.
Cellular slime molds are rarely visible to the naked eye. Plasmodial slime mold threads on rotting wood. On the other hand, plasmodial slime molds start out as individual amoeboid cells, but join together to form a multi-nucleate mass having only one cellular membrane (a "super-cell" containing multiple nuclei).
There are more than 900 species of slime mold in the world. Slime mold are amoebas which grow on rotting wood and other decomposing things.
Slime mold is not a plant or animal. It’s not a fungus, though it sometimes resembles one. Slime mold, in fact, is a soil-dwelling amoeba, a brainless, single-celled organism, often containing multiple nuclei.
Researchers have found a slime mold cast in amber that remains entirely unchanged from what you could find in a modern forest, dating back at least 100 million years. Slime molds in general, though, have probably been squishing their way around Earth for around a billion years. In fact, it's possible they're one of the first multicellular-ish organisms created by single cells joining together.
All slime molds have in common is their life cycle, loosely resembling that of a fungus, which is why taxonomists lumped them in the fungi kingdom for so long. Basically, when they've vacuumed as much food out of their environs as they can, they turn their bodies into clusters of spore packets, usually on stalks and sometimes wildly colored, called sporangia.
In the 1930s America saw the creation of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, featuring the 'button mushroom' Agaricus bisporus. The popularity of this product helped make mushrooms a mainstream food stuff in American cuisine. Today most of the button mushrooms in America are produced in a concentrated, monoculture focused center at Kennett Square, PA, U.S.A. by businesses run by 3-5th generation families.
The agricultural cultivation of L. edodes was first reported in China about 800 years ago [4] and modern cultivation methods using the pure cultivated mycelium were developed in Japan in the 1930s.
Ötzi, also called the Iceman, is the natural mummy of a man who lived between 3350 and 3105 BC. Ötzi's remains were discovered on 19 September 1991, in the Ötztal Alps. Fastened to leather bands in his equipment, researchers found the birch polypore fungus, which the Iceman may have used to calm inflammation or as an antibiotic.
These polypores are among some of the most popular edible polypores of foragers: Albatrellus spp., Bondarzewia berkeleyi, Cerioporus squamosus, Fistulina hepatica, Grifola frondosa, Ischnoderma resinosum, Laetiporus cincinnatus and Laetiporus sulphureus, Meripilus sumsteinei, Polyporus umbellatus, Sparassis spp.
King Boletes are among the most prized of edible fungi of Europe, second only to truffles in gustatory appeal. They are characterized by large reddish-brown, smooth caps that are viscid when wet and that have white pores on the underside that become tawny with age. One popular species in north america is the highly prized Boletus rubriceps (genetically sequenced and ID'd in 2014), commonly referenced as the "Rocky Mountain Red"
King Boletes are the most prized of edible fungi worldwide, second only to truffles. They are characterized by large reddish-brown (look like a bun), w/smooth caps which are viscid when wet. Undersides have white pores becoming tawny with age. The most popular B. ssp. in North America is the prized Boletus rubriceps, commonly called the "Rocky Mountain Red."
Hericium means hedgehog in Latin. This species often fruits high on living tree trunks in Asia, Europe, and North America and generally throughout the North temperate latitudes. The fruit bodies typically have short stalks.
Quercus gambelii, with the common name Gambel Oak (oak scrub | brush | white), is a particularly hardy deciduous small tree or shrub widespread in the foothills and lower mountains of western North America. While many oak species do well in our Rocky Mountain climate, only this species is considered a Colorado native plant. This is cheap, easy to harvest, and highly desired for cultivating oak loving saprophytic mycelium.

Oyster mushrooms are carnivorous, in they may digest nematodes.
The bioactive metabolites from mushrooms are majorly grouped as lectins, polysaccharides, phenolic and polyphenolics, terpenoids, ergosterols and volatile organic compounds such as ceramides. These bioactive metabolites also have immuno-modulating properties.
Coffee grounds are commonly used in mushroom substrate. Pure spent coffee grinds are too acidic for most species of mycelium to grow. Adding a buffer like a salt based (calcium, potassium, magnesium) carbonate like Arm and Hammer (tm) baking soda may help achieve a desirable pH for a given species. Oysters seem to like 50% coffee grinds, 50% hard wood sawdust/pellets by weight, and about 120 grams/15L mix.

Holding over 1.25 million dried specimens, Kew’s Fungarium collection is the largest, one of the oldest and most scientifically important, in the world. There are samples of fungi from all seven continents, spanning the entire fungal tree of life and representing well over half of known global diversity.
Mushrooms start out as mycelium, a branching, thread-like colony of fungus. The mycelium is grown in compost, which is why you often see mushrooms growing out of dead tree branches or logs on a forest floor. In order to propagate, the mycelium sense the right combination of temperature and moisture in the air to flower. The result is a mushroom fruiting body, which is produced, harvested, sold and eaten.
